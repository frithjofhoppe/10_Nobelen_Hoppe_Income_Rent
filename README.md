# :money_with_wings: 10 Income <-> Rent vizualisation


:rocket: The website is automatically deployed as github page [https://frithjofhoppe.github.io/10_Nobelen_Hoppe_Income_Rent/](https://frithjofhoppe.github.io/10_Nobelen_Hoppe_Income_Rent/)

## :fire: Our idea
Almost everyone who looked once for an apartment came along the question ... how much can I actually spent on my rent? aaaaand then after the disillusionment ... why is everything so f* expensive :-)? For that reason we took rent and income data from the swiss federal statistical office and compared the data based on the geographic and the education level of earners in switzerland. Our goal is to find out where housing takes bigger part of the income of people / larger disparity. The general story is told with the website itself. The idea was that the reader start this kind of journey across the different vizualization and after getting presented the in our pov pressing facts can explore him/herself or from people the reader knows e.g. family, friends etc who are living in a different canton etc.

> :rotating_light: The data sets are not available in english, thats the reason why the displayed content on the website is as well in german
