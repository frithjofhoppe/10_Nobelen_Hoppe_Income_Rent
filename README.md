## :fire: Our idea
Almost everyone who looked once for an apartment came along the question ... how much can I actually spent on my rent? aaaaand then after the disillusionment ... why is everything so f* expensive :-)?

We took rent and income data from the swiss federal statistical office and compared the data based on the geographic and the education level of earners
