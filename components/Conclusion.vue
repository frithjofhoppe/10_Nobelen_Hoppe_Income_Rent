        Data-based analysis shows that living in Switzerland is strongly influenced by regional and social differences
        . Rents and incomes are unevenly distributed – both geographically and in terms of education,
        gender, and professional status. While urban and economically strong regions such as Zurich, Geneva, and
        Zug offer high incomes, rents are also particularly high here. This means that those who earn well
        usually also have to pay more for housing. But this equation does not work for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        People with lower educational qualifications, without management positions, or from structurally weaker regions
        are coming under increasing pressure. In many cases, rent significantly exceeds the recommended 30% limit of
        net income – an indicator of housing cost burden. Working people in
        Ticino and urban centers, where even smaller apartments are comparatively expensive, are particularly affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        These imbalances have far-reaching consequences. People with lower incomes are forced to live in
        cheaper – mostly rural – regions. At the same time, well-paid jobs continue to be concentrated
        in expensive urban centers. This creates a spatial separation between where people live and where they work,
        which can affect not only
        individual quality of life but also social cohesion. Those who seek access
        attractive jobs often have to accept long commutes or spend a large portion of their
        income on housing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, the data highlights persistent structural wage inequality between the sexes – even
        among those with the same qualifications. Women systematically earn less than men, which makes it even more
        difficult for them to afford housing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conclusion: The housing situation in Switzerland is not just a question of rent, but also of access to
        opportunities.
        Affordable housing means more than just a roof over one's head—it is a key factor in social
        participation, economic mobility, and quality of life. A sustainable housing policy should therefore focus more
        on
        regional balance, fair wages, and affordable housing for all population groups.
