        Our data speaks for itself: the gap between wages and housing costs is widening – and along clear lines:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Urban centers such as Zurich, Zug, and Geneva charge disproportionately high rents, especially for family apartments.</li>
        <li>Wages are heavily dependent on education, region, and gender. The gender pay gap remains a reality – in all regions.</li>
        <li>The 30% rule is hardly tenable for broad sections of the population – especially in the lower to middle income segment.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        What remains is a structural imbalance: those who earn more live where it is expensive – often without any
        problems. Those who earn less have little choice. Our visualizations make these invisible factors visible.
